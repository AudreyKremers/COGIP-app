## Project

For this project, we had to realize an accounting web application for a fictive company named COGIP. To develop this application we have to use PHP and MySQL languages.

Guy worked on the general layout of the app, managed the users login to the application and implemented a CRUD functionality for the contacts.

Audrey has implemented a CRUD functionality for the invoices.

Jean-Marc worked on the creation of the MySQL Database and implemented a CRUD functionality for the companies.
